Currently just a custom theme: `emj`.

## Installation

Warp is currently still in beta. I have several invites left, so if you'd like one, [let me know](https://ejonokuchi.com/about.html#contact).

Warp doesn't seem to detect symlinks, so you'll have to copy the themes over directly:

```bash
cp "${HOME}/.config/warp/themes"/* "${HOME}/.warp/themes/"
```

To select the theme, navigate to `Preferences > Appearance` and click on `Current theme`:
